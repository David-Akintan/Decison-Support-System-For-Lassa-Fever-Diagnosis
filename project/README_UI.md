  "age_recode": 35,
  "sex_new2": 1,
  "fever_new": 1,
  "headache_new": 1,
  "contact_with_lassa_case": 0,
  "State_new": "Edo"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "prediction": {
    "prediction": 0,
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "lassa_probability": 0.15
  },
  "interpretation": {
    "diagnosis": "NEGATIVE for Lassa Fever",
    "risk_level": "LOW",
    "recommendation": "Low probability of Lassa fever..."
  }
}
```

## Clinical Features

The system analyzes 51 clinical parameters including:

### Demographics
- Age, Sex, Pregnancy status

### Clinical Symptoms
- Fever, Headache, Vomiting, Bleeding
- Weakness, Abdominal pain, Diarrhea
- Respiratory symptoms, Joint/muscle pain

### Epidemiological Factors
- Contact with confirmed Lassa cases
- Travel history to endemic areas
- Rodent/excreta exposure

### Geographic Information
- State/region of residence

## Risk Stratification

- **HIGH RISK (‚â•70%)**: Immediate isolation and testing recommended
- **MODERATE RISK (30-69%)**: Close monitoring and clinical judgment
- **LOW RISK (<30%)**: Standard care with symptom monitoring

## Performance Metrics

- **Overall Accuracy**: 80-85%
- **Lassa Detection Rate**: 40-70% (sensitivity for minority class)
- **AUC Score**: 0.75-0.85
- **F1 Score**: 0.70-0.80

## Usage Workflow

1. **Train Model**: Run `train.py` with your dataset
2. **Launch Interface**: Start `app.py` to open web interface
3. **Input Patient Data**: Use the assessment form to enter clinical information
4. **Review Results**: Analyze AI predictions and clinical recommendations
5. **Clinical Decision**: Use results to support medical decision-making

## Security Considerations

- No patient data is stored permanently
- All processing occurs locally
- Secure session management
- Input validation and sanitization
- HTTPS recommended for production deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Model Not Loading
- Ensure `model.pth` and `preproc.pkl` exist
- Check model was trained successfully
- Verify PyTorch version compatibility

### Prediction Errors
- Validate input data format
- Check feature compatibility with training data
- Ensure all required fields are provided

### Performance Issues
- Use GPU acceleration if available
- Optimize batch sizes for your hardware
- Consider model quantization for deployment
